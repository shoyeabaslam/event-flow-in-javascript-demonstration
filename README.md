# Animated Element Removal with setInterval

This project demonstrates the animated removal of elements from a list using the `setInterval` method. The goal is to achieve a visually appealing animation effect while removing elements one after another from the list.

## Overview

- **Remove Elements:** The script utilizes `setInterval` to remove elements from the list one by one, creating a smooth animation effect.

- **Dynamic Changes:** Elements are removed using the `firstChild` property, allowing for a dynamic demonstration of the removal process.

- **Static Array Creation:** The `Array.from()` method is employed to create a static array of child nodes without affecting dynamic changes in the `childNodes` collection.

- **Element Creation:** The script includes a function (`createChild`) to dynamically create child elements, making it easy to customize and add new elements to the list.

- **Stack and Queue Demonstration:** The project provides a clear demonstration of stack and queue principles in the removal process, showcasing the order in which elements are processed.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/animated-element-removal.git`
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Customize
